    <h1>ABOUT US <span>//</span></h1>
    <p>
      Our family business originated in 1977 when the now deceased Mr. Javed Alam commenced the production and exportation of leather and non-leather saddlery, harnesses, and pet products.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1988, he went on to establish Eastern Saddlery. Nowadays, Faraz Alam, his son, leads the company in its latest avatar as Leather Art.
    </p>
    <p>
      We now manufacture assorted Leather goods and non Leather articles. Though the core of our business still remains manufacturing Leather Saddlery goods.
